# ToDo-List
A simple frontend TODO List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with localStorage. Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed


# My Todo List Project

Hey there! 👋 This is a simple **TODO list app** I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It lets you add tasks, mark them as done, edit them, and delete them. All your tasks are saved right in your browser using **localStorage**, so you won’t lose them if you refresh the page.

## Features
- Add new tasks quickly
- Click on a task to mark it as completed
- Edit or delete tasks anytime
- Your tasks stay saved in the browser
- Bright, colorful design because coding should be fun! 🎨

## How to Use
1. Open My demo link in any browser.
2. Type a task and hit **Add**.
3. Click a task to mark it as done.
4. Edit or delete tasks using the buttons next to them.

It’s beginner-friendly but fully functional—perfect for a mini project demo. 😎
